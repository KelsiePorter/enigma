# enigma

#### **Functionality -**
##### Meets expectations. Using the command line interface shows that the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods are both functioning properly.

#### **Object Oriented Programming -**
##### Above expectations for including inheritance (`cypher` superclass) and one module (`generator`). The `cypher` superclass hosts methods used to shift the keys for both `encrypt` and `decrypt`and includes methods from the `generator` module. The `generator` module hosts methods used to generate the alphabet, random key, and today's date. Meets expectations for class size/knowledge/behavior and single responsibilities.

#### **Ruby Conventions and Mechanics -**
##### Meets expectations for indentation, length of lines, following naming conventions. My code is properly indented, spaced, and lines have been kept fairly short. The `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods are 7 lines, however, their helper methods are much longer. Meets expectations for enumerables, data structures, and implementing a hash.

#### **Test Driven Development -**
##### Above Expectations for using stubs where testing was otherwise not possible due to randomness. Meets expectations for both unit and intergration level tests. Edge cases such as unique characters are addresses and tested. SimpleCov shows 100% test coverage. Meets expectations for git history showing that I used TDD during the entire project.

#### **Version Control -**
##### Above Expectations for version control with 6 pull requests and 55+ commits. I very rarely commited for more that one piece of functionality. I tried to practice developer empathy with my commit messages and branch names.
